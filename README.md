# SLIME DEMO

## quick start example with hbs, tachyons, & slime-utilities

everything you can do w/ slime + slime utilities, examples for how to do common things
  here is a very quick and easy workflow to help you get things done ... fast and in a way that (probably) won't blow up in your face at some point in the future

if you like this building things w/ this workflow, check out darkwave (it's a cms & copypasta components/patterns for quickly building out all kinds of functionality)

focus on getting something up and running quickly that you can deploy with little effort and then leave it running and forget about it :)

there's an example w/ twig, just know you gotta install twig + render to use it


if you wanna run this demo on your server, copy the files (git clone or npx degit) and then do composer install

take a look at the [slime](https://github.com/hxgf/slime) requirements and set up
